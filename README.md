## About me

I'm Gabor Meszaros (he/him), a Hungarian software developer with a BSc in Computing and IT (Software). I am currently working as a Software Engineer at the Hungarian office of a  Swiss software company. On my current project, I am working on the Angular (8-12) frontend of a hybrid mobile and web application using Ionic and Capacitor. I am also working with RxJS, NgRx on a daily basis, and utilizing a Java Spring backend with OAuth2.0. The build is done in Gradle, and we're using both a GoCD and Azure DevOps CI/CD. I am also familiar with Jira and Azure DevOps (TFS).

As a fun fact, I think I should mention that I used to be an Air Traffic Controller for 11 years, so I have *some* knowledge of aviation and air traffic management in general. Not to mention my past in Incident Investigation and other ATM expert work. As a hobby, I've sunk thousands of hours into flight simulation as well, so if you have any questions on these topics, I'll gladly try to answer them.

## My projects

### TylerLevsMusic Web Application ([repo](https://github.com/MikeSierra88/tlm-web-app))
([web](https://tylerlevs.com))

A portfolio website for an indie musician. Continuously expanding in features, and moving towards fully dynamic content. Halfway there.

MEAN-stack running on Firebase - the Angular 13 frontend (with Bootstrap 5) is served from Firebase Hosting as a static build, while the Express-based NestJS API is hosted on Heroku. Using MongoDB as the database using the NestJS-Mongoose interface. Custom content management (admin) interface using Auth0 for OAuth permission-based authorization with Google social login integration. Dynamic content is served in the database, while on the frontend it is (mostly) stored in NgRx - migration still in progress. Utilizes GitHub actions for CI/CD to Firebase.

Previously on AWS EC2.

A web application to manage office videogame leagues between friends.

Currently offline. In the present state, it's using Express.js API with EJS server-side rendering to serve Bootstrap-based frontend, and a MongoDB database. Basic username-password session-based authentication. Multiple access levels. Plans are to revive the project and move it to Next.js using a React/Redux frontend
