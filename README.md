## About me

I'm Gabor Meszaros (he/him), a Hungarian software developer with a BSc in Computing and IT (Software). I am currently working as a Software Engineer at the Hungarian office of a  Swiss software company. On my current project, I am working on the Angular (8-12) frontend of a hybrid mobile and web application using Ionic and Capacitor. I am also working with RxJS, NgRx on a daily basis, and utilizing a Java Spring backend with OAuth2.0. The build is done in Gradle, and we're using both a GoCD and Azure DevOps CI/CD. I am also familiar with Jira and Azure DevOps (TFS).

As a fun fact, I think I should mention that I used to be an Air Traffic Controller for 11 years, so I have *some* knowledge of aviation and air traffic management in general. Not to mention my past in Incident Investigation and other ATM expert work. As a hobby, I've sunk thousands of hours into flight simulation as well, so if you have any questions on these topics, I'll gladly try to answer them.

## My hobby projects

### TylerLevsMusic Web Application ([repo](https://github.com/MikeSierra88/tlm-web-app))
([web](https://tylerlevs.com))

A portfolio website for an indie musician. Continuously expanding in features, and moving towards fully dynamic content. Halfway there.

Currently a MEAN-stack running on Firebase - the Angular 13 frontend (with Bootstrap 5) is served from Firebase Hosting as a static build, while the Express-based NestJS API is in Firebase Functions. Using MongoDB as the database. Planning to implement an Admin interface and API with Firebase Auth. Dynamic content is stored in the database. Utilizes GitHub actions for CI/CD to Firebase.

Previously on AWS EC2.

### LeagueWizard Web Application ([repo](https://github.com/MikeSierra88/leaguewizard))

A web application to manage office videogame leagues between friends.

Currently offline. In the present state, it's using Express.js API with EJS server-side rendering to serve Bootstrap-based frontend, and a MongoDB database. Basic username-password session-based authentication. Multiple access levels. Plans are to revive the project and move it to Next.js using a React/Redux frontend
