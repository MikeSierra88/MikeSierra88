## About me

I'm Gabor Meszaros (he/him), a Hungarian software developer with a BSc in Computing and IT (Software). I am currently working as a Software Engineer at the Hungarian office of a  Swiss software company. On my current project, I am working on the Angular (8-12) frontend of a hybrid mobile and web application using Ionic and Capacitor. I am also working with RxJS, NgRx on a daily basis, and utilizing a Java Spring backend with OAuth2.0. The build is done in Gradle, and we're using both a GoCD and Azure DevOps CI/CD. I am also familiar with Jira and Azure DevOps (TFS). In my hobby projects, I am working with React (and formerly, Redux), NextJS, MongoDB, Material UI, Emotion, GitHub Actions.

As a fun fact, I think I should mention that I used to be an Air Traffic Controller for 11 years, so I have *some* knowledge of aviation and air traffic management in general. Not to mention my past in Incident Investigation and other ATM expert work. As a hobby, I've sunk thousands of hours into flight simulation as well, so if you have any questions on these topics, I'll gladly try to answer them.
